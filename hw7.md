# Homework 7, Part A: Merge-Sorting a Linked List

In this assignment, we will walk you through implementing merge sort for a linked list.
In addition to the coding problems, we ask you to answer **open-response questions** and submit your answers in a file called `Answers.txt`.


<br/>


## Task 0: Creating your BlueJ project

Create a BlueJ project with the following starter code.

`LinearList.java`:
```java
public interface LinearList<T> {
    public boolean isEmpty();
    public int size();
    public T get(int position);
    public void insert(int position, T element);
    public T remove(int position);
    public String toString();
}
```

`LinearNode.java`:
```java
public class LinearNode<T> {
   private LinearNode<T> next;
   private T element;

   public LinearNode() {
      next = null;
      element = null;
   }

   public LinearNode(T elem) {
      next = null;
      element = elem;
   }

   public LinearNode<T> getNext() {
      return next;
   }

   public void setNext(LinearNode<T> node) {
      next = node;
   }

   public T getElement() {
      return element;
   }

   public void setElement(T elem) {
      element = elem;
   }
}
```

`LinkedList.java`:
```java
public class LinkedList<T> implements LinearList<T> {
    protected LinearNode<T> front;
    protected int count;
    
    public LinkedList() {
        this.front = null;
        this.count = 0;
    }
    
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return this.count == 0;
    }
    
    public int size() {
        return this.count;
    }

    protected LinearNode<T> getNode(int position) {
        if (position < 0 || position >= this.count) {
            throw new RuntimeException(
                "Asking for element at index " + position 
                + " in a list of size" + this.count
            );
        }
        
        LinearNode<T> current = this.front;
        for (int i = 0; i < position; i++) {
            current = current.getNext();
        }
        
        return current;
    }
    
    public T get(int position) {
        LinearNode<T> node = this.getNode(position);
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        return node.getElement();
    }
    
    public void insert(int position, T element) {
        LinearNode<T> node = new LinearNode<T>(element);
        
        if (position == 0) {
            node.setNext(front);
            front = node;
        } else {
            LinearNode<T> before = this.getNode(position - 1);
            node.setNext(before.getNext());
            before.setNext(node);
        }
        
        this.count++;
    }
    
    public T remove(int position) {
        LinearNode<T> current;
        if (position == 0) {
            current = front;
            front = front.getNext();
        } else {
            LinearNode<T> before = this.getNode(position - 1);
            current = before.getNext();
            before.setNext(current.getNext());
        }  
        
        this.count--;
        return current.getElement();
    }

    public String toString() {
        String s = "[ ";
        
        LinearNode<T> current = this.front;
        for (int i = 0; i < this.size(); i++) {
            s += current.getElement().toString() + ", ";
            current = current.getNext();
        }
        
        return s + "]";
    }
}
```

Then, answer:
* Which instance variables/methods are `protected`?
* Why would we choose to make them `protected` instead of `private` for this assignment?


<br/>

## Task 1

**Instructions.** Create a class, `SortableLinkedList`, with the following header:

```java
public class SortableLinkedList<T extends Comparable<T>> extends LinkedList<T> {
  ...
}
```

This is the class in which you will implement your sortable linked list.

**Answer.**
* What does each part of the syntax in the class header mean?
* Why do we mention `Comparable<T>` in the class header?





<br/>

## Task 2

**Instructions.** Implement a helper method with the following header:
```java
private SortableLinkedList<T> split() {
  ...
}
```

This method cuts `this` linked list into two halves.
The left half should remain in `this`, while the right half should be returned as its own linked list.
This method should take no more than O(N) time.

**Tests.** After implementing this method, **test it** in the `main` method of the same file.
You can store the results of all of your testing in `SortableLinkedlistTesting.txt`.
We highly recommend you **do not** continue without confidence this method words correctly.




<br/>

## Task 3

**Instructions.** Implement a helper method with the following header:
```java
private void reverse() {
  ...
}
```

As the name suggests, this method should reverse the order of the nodes in the linked list.
This method should take no more than O(N) time.

**Hint.** You should be able to do this with a single while loop and without any additional data structures.
If you wish, you may use a Queue or Stack from the Java API (only using the appropriate methods).

**Tests.** As before, after implementing this method, **test it** in the `main` method of the same file.
We highly recommend you **do not** continue without confidence this method words correctly.



<br/>

## Task 4

**Instructions.** Implement a helper method with the following header:
```java
private void merge(SortableLinkedList<T> right) {
  ...
}
```

This method takes in a second linked list, `right`, and merges into `this` linked list, using merge-sort's merge algorithm.
This method should take no more than O(N) time.

**Hints.**
* You may want to create a **new linked list** to contain the merged elements. Then, you can assign its contents to `this`.
* You should do this **without** any pointer manipulation, only relying on other methods of the linked list.
* Consider using the helper methods you've already implemented.

**Tests.** As before, after implementing this method, **test it** in the `main` method of the same file.
We highly recommend you **do not** continue without confidence this method words correctly.



<br/>

## Task 5

**Instructions.** Finally, implement merge sort:
```java
public void sort() {
  ...
}
```

**Hint.** Every helper method above you haven't yet used will be helpful here.

**Tests.** Don't forget to test your sorting algorithm!
For ease of checking your code, you may want to sort something simple, like integers, instead of strings:
```java
SortableLinkedList<Integer> l = new SortableLinkedList<Integer>();
l.insert(0, 0);
...
```

# Homework 7, Part B: Big-O



Consider the following method that removes a CD from a linear collection (e.g. array):

<img src="_images/figs/code.png" alt="code to remove a CD from an array" style="width: 750px;"/>

Assume that the collection has `N` CDs to start with.
Please write the Big-O of every line marked in the code.
For lines inside a loop, please write the Big-O of the line, *accounting for its repetition*.
Write your answer in a text file called `BigO.txt` and submit it.

**Note:** If you find any of the questions ambiguous (that is, if you believe there are multiple interpretations), give your answer *for each interpretation*.





<br/>

# Homework 7, Part B: Trace Sorting by hand


## Learning Goals
* Gain a detailed understanding on how sorting algorithms work
* Working with best-known sorting algorithms

## Exercise: Trace Sorting Algorithms

Complete the following questions on paper by hand, scan them as a PDF, and submit as the file `SortingTrace.pdf` to Gradescope.

Given the following array of numbers:

`255 31 15 127 511 1023 63 7 2047`

Show a trace of execution for each of the sorting methods as shown in the book:

1. selection sort (listing 13.5, page 492)
2. insertion sort (listing 13.5, page 493)
3. merge sort (listing 13.5, page 495)

The meaning of **"trace"** depends on each sorting method.

* For selection sort, it means to display the contents of the array at every selection.
* For insertion sort, it means to display the contents of the array after each insertion.
* For mergesort, it means to draw the two trees that are created by splitting and merging.


## What to submit
* Make sure you title your paper and you write your name(s) on the document you are submitting.
* Create a PDF file named `SortingTrace.pdf` by scanning the completed worksheet and submit to Gradescope.
